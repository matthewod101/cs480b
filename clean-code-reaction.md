1. One of the things that are on the "do not do" portion of the clean code document which I know I tend to do is that when I create a 
variable, I do not give the name much context to what it could be representing.  Most of the time, the name I give it is something 
that is short and that I can understand the connection to.  Such examples include using the first letter of the object as the name
of the variable.

2. One point that surprised me on the clean code document is that Hungarian notation is a real thing and that it is used enough 
to be called out in this document.  I had never known that anything like Hungarian notation existed as it never occured to 
me to apply the type of variable into the name of the variable.

3. One thing that I do not agree with on the clean code document is the idea that the singleton pattern should not be used.  If there 
is a project in the works and the clear best way to implement it is to use the singleton pattern, then why would it not be used.  I 
understand that it may be difficult in the future for someone to read the code, but if the programmer states that they used the 
singleton pattern in their implementation and provided a valid reason for using it, then there is no reason for it to not be allowed.
